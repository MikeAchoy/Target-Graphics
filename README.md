# Target-Accuracy-Graphics
This project was made to work with the coordinate system and equations to perform analysis on points within a grid. In this case, the points are random points that are drawn the target, and an analyzer object will perform an analysis of accuracy, and precision, based on where the random points landed on it.

Use PaintBrush functions in MyCanvas class. Run App class to run code, analysis and points will be outputted to console. 

To Run quickly, download the code and `ls` into the project directory. Compile the `.java` files:

To compile the files run `javac App.java Analizer.java MyCanvas.java PaintBrush.java` in the project directory.

Then run the project `java App`
